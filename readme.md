## Features
1. Crossplatform chat
- Display yt, twitch, kick etc, in one terminal window.

2. Collect points.
- Normal coins, that can be collected via watchtime (channelpoints), following,
subscribing & gifting subs. (this might be a twitch exclusive)
- Premium coins, only from sub, gift, donation.
- This should be crossplatform, and not a twitch exclusive.

3. Store points
- Storage is going to be complicated. Local storage is risky but might be easier
for average users, cloud storage is easy, but expensive.

- Collect "get chatters" to filter out only the people who are currently watching
